That's one rep.", "JACK IN AND OUT - With feet wide, lower into a deep squat and extend arms out to the sides of shoulders, palms facing up. Jump up out of squat, bringing feet together and clapping hands overhead. That's one rep.", "BUTT BLASTER - This exercise will tone the muscles of your hamstrings, glutes and lower back. Begin by getting on your hands and knees on the floor. Your hands should be directly underneath your shoulders and your thighs should be at a right angle to your torso. Next, take one leg and extend it upward as high in the air as you can, squeezing the glutes throughout the movement. Return to the starting position and do the same with the opposite leg.","PLANK SQUAT HOPS - Begin in a straight-arm plank, with feet together and abs braced in tight. Bend knees and quickly jump legs forward, landing in a deep squat with toes just outside of hands. Immediately jump back out to plank position.", "SQUAT JUMP - With your feet hip-width apart, squat until your thighs are parallel to the floor, and then jump as high as you can.
